# Max-Flow Algorithm:- Tunnels problem and Gomory-Hu tree

Implemented an application for a famous algorithmic problem, namely the tunnels problem solved
using the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm.Used the same algorithm to build a Gomory-Hu tree to represent all minimum s-t cuts
for all the s-t pairs in a graph.
